# XAI-Based-Data-Envelopment-Analysis-Target-Setting

This library contains code developed for an XAI-based Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) target-setting decision support tool. The code is primarily written in MATLAB, with some parts implemented in Python.

The Python portion focuses on applying multiple machine learning algorithms to the dataset. The model with the highest predictive performance is then selected for explainability analysis using the LIME method.

The MATLAB code implements multi-objective optimization for DEA target setting.
